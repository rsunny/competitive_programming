<p>In a class room there are <b>n</b> students. One day the teacher brought <b>m</b> different board games to the class. Each student has a particular interest level in each board game.</p>

<p>Each board game requires 2 teams to play it. Each team consists of 2 students. Student pairs up with only few other students. You are given <b>k</b> pairs, where each pair can form a possible team. Each student can either be a part of one team and one board game or can be a left over. </p>

<p>Interest level of each team is defined as maximum interest level of the two students in the team. Fun on each board game is defined as product of <b>interest</b> levels of each team playing on that particular board. Fun of the class room is defined as the summation of fun on each board game.</p>

<p>If every i-th student who is left over with out being assigned to any board game, the fun of the class room decreases by <b>bad[i]</b>. Teacher tries to assign teams to each board game such that she can bring maximum fun to the class. Help her in that assignment and find the maximum fun that can be brought to the class.
